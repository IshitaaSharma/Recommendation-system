# Recommendation System
Project Overview:

This project is a movie recommendation system designed to suggest shows and movies based on user preferences and input. Utilizing content-based filtering techniques, the system analyzes various features of movies and shows to provide personalized recommendations.

Features:-


Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies and shows by evaluating the content similarity of titles based on features such as director, cast, country, genre, and description.

Fuzzy Matching: Implements fuzzy matching to handle variations in movie titles and ensure accurate recommendations, even if there are minor misspellings or differences in title formatting.

Detailed Metadata: Provides comprehensive details about each show or movie, including title, director, cast, release year, rating, duration, genre, and a brief description.

Data Integration: Combines data from multiple sources (Amazon Prime, Disney+ Hotstar, and Netflix) into a unified dataset, allowing for a broad range of recommendations across different platforms.
